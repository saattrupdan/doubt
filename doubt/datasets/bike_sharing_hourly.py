    Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where
    whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.
    Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a
    particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there
    are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is
    composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great
    interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic,
    environmental and health issues.

    Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems,
    the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them
    attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as
    bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is
    explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing
    system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility
    in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the
    city could be detected via monitoring these data.

    Examples:
        Load in the data set::

            >>> dataset = BikeSharingHourly()
            >>> dataset.shape
            (17379, 16)

        Split the data set into features and targets, as NumPy arrays::

            >>> X, y = dataset.split()
            >>> X.shape, y.shape
            ((17379, 13), (17379, 3))

        Perform a train/test split, also outputting NumPy arrays::

            >>> train_test_split = dataset.split(test_size=0.2, random_seed=42)
            >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split
            >>> X_train.shape, y_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_test.shape
            ((13878, 13), (13878, 3), (3501, 13), (3501, 3))

        Output the underlying Pandas DataFrame::

            >>> df = dataset.to_pandas()
            >>> type(df)
            <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
